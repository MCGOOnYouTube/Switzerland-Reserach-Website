# Switzerland-Research-Website

This website started from a French project I am currently working on as of 10-11-2022, and I thought to myself, why not
make a website as I LOVE coding. This made me upload it here for GitHub Pages - https://markusmcgo.github.io/ - but you
can also check out all the code here :)

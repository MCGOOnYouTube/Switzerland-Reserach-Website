          <p>
            This enchanting mountain is one of the tallest in the Alps,
            straddling the border between Switzerland and Italy. It is a large,
            near-symmetric pyramidal peak in the extended Monte Rosa area of the
            Pennine Alps, whose summit is 4,478 metres (14,692 ft) high, making
            it one of the highest summits in the Alps and Europe. The mountain
            overlooks the beautiful Swiss town of Zermatt, in the canton of
            Valais, to the north-east and the Italian town of Breuil-Cervinia in
            the Aosta Valley to the south.

          <p>
            This gorgeous waterfall is located in Switzerland and the most
            powerful waterfall in Europe. The falls are located on the High
            Rhine on the border between the cantons of Schaffhausen and Zürich,
            between the municipalities of Neuhausen am Rheinfall and
            Laufen-Uhwiesen/Dachsen , next to the town of Schaffhausen in
            northern Switzerland. They are 150 metres (490 ft) wide and 23
            metres (75 ft) high. The best time to visit is in June and July,
            when the mountain snow melts and the falls puff and swell, a
            gorgeous view to see.

          <p>
            Lake Lugano is stunning glacial lake which is situated on the border
            between southern Switzerland and northern Italy. The lake, named
            after the nearby city of Lugano, is situated between the dazzling
            Lake Como and Lago Maggiore. There are various mountains and tourist
            destinations on the shores of the lake including Monte Brè to the
            east, Monte San Salvatore west of Lugano, and Monte Generoso on the
            south-eastern shore. The World Heritage Site Monte San Giorgio is
            situated south of the lake. Also located to the south is the Cinque
            Vette Park. The lake is drained by the Tresa, which empties into
            Lake Maggiore, the latter being drained by the Ticino and the Po.
